# my_INFO550_repo
This repo contains a project I am working on for my Data Science toolkit class.
The health_insurance.csv data set was downloaded from Kaggle and it contains a cross-section of Health related variables for a sample of 1338 individuals.
For this project, the dependent variable would be Expenses.
I plan to build a model that uses other variables in the data set to predict potential yearly health expenses for a given patient.
Code would be written exclusively in R and a .R and .Rmd file
